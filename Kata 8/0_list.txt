Find the smallest integer in the array

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
For example:
Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

---------
Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light

You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.
Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.
For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

---------
Sum without highest and lowest number

Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).
The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.
Mind the input validation.
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
Input validation
If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.

---------
A Needle in the Haystack
Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:
Example(Input --> Output):
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 

---------
Even or Odd
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

---------
Descending Order
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

---------
Highest and Lowest

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

---------
Jaden Casing Strings
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

---------
Basic Mathematical Operations
Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.
Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7

Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59

---------
Grasshopper - Summation
Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

For example (Input -> Output):
2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

--------------
Sum of positive
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

--------
Remove First and Last Character
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.

--------------
How good are you really?
There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

--------------
Binary Addition
Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.
Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
